    "text": "Step 0: Take a little break\nIn my experience, 99% of errors are the result of stuff like misspelling a variable or forgetting to load a package and they‚Äôre completely obvious once you‚Äôve spotted them. There‚Äôs no way around this, it happens to everyone. The only real advice I can offer here is: take a break and relax your brain. Go for a walk. Eat a sandwich. Pet a cat, etc. Then come back with a fresh set of eyes and retrace your steps to see if you can spot something that looks out of place.\nOnce you‚Äôve done this, take a look at the offending output and see if you can get any clues about its origins. When you see messages like: Error in foo() : could not find function \"foo\" or Error: object 'x' not found its often either a misspelling or its the result of a variable or function that hasn‚Äôt been loaded into R yet.\nOther messages are a little harder to parse, but you can often copy-paste the error into a search engine and you‚Äôll find that other people have gotten help for the same issue. R has a big community of users, and so there‚Äôs a good chance that someone else has encountered the same problem you‚Äôre having and has written about how to solve it. Similarly, if you‚Äôre having an issue with a particular function, consult the help file and see if you can find any useful information there.\nWhen this fails, then move on to step 1.",

    "text": "Step 2: Try to replicate the issue\nNow that you have a fresh R instance, try to replicate your problem. Make a new script and call it something like ‚Äúerror_replication‚Äù and then try to replicate your error message in as few steps as possible. Remember that you‚Äôll need to re-load any packages or data you‚Äôve been using for your analysis first. For GVPT 201, that usually means at least running library(RCPA3) and possibly loading one of the world, nes, gss or states data sets.\nRun through each line of code one step at a time until you encounter the problem. If you want to be absolutely sure that your code can be replicated, repeat step 1 and then press the ‚Äúsource‚Äù button at the top right of the script editor. This will run the entire script in sequence.\nHere‚Äôs an example of a common error that comes from trying to use the max function on a variable that isn‚Äôt numeric. I might have a lot of other code in my original script, but I only need four lines to replicate this error message and you can easily recreate it yourself by copying these same lines:\n\n# Step 1: After restarting Rstudio and clearing the environment...\n# Step 2: I load the required packages ----\nlibrary(RCPA3)\n# and import the \"world\" data set and assign it to a variable\nworld&lt;-RCPA3::world\n\n# Step 3: And then I recreate my error message----\nmax(world$election.violence.post)\n\nError in Summary.factor(structure(c(1L, NA, 1L, NA, 1L, 2L, 1L, 1L, 1L, : 'max' not meaningful for factors\n\n\nIsolating the problem like this can usually make it a lot easier to spot the source of the issue, but if you can replicate the error and you‚Äôre still not sure how to fix it, then its probably time to move on to the next step.",
